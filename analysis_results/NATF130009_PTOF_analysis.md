# Analisi del PTOF ITG-POLITECNICO-FERMI-GADDA

## Report di Valutazione dell'Orientamento

### 1. Sintesi Generale
Il PTOF dell'ITG-POLITECNICO-FERMI-GADDA presenta un approccio all'orientamento che, pur non essendo esplicitamente strutturato in una sezione dedicata, è integrato in diverse aree del piano. L'orientamento è visto principalmente come un supporto alla crescita personale e professionale degli studenti, con un focus sulle competenze tecniche e pratiche. Il livello di maturità dell'orientamento è valutabile come sufficiente, con margini di miglioramento nell'integrazione e nella sistematicità delle azioni. La valutazione complessiva è influenzata dalla mancanza di una visione strategica chiara e di obiettivi misurabili.

### 2. Analisi Dimensionale

#### 2.1 Sezione Dedicata all'Orientamento
L'assenza di una sezione specifica dedicata all'orientamento rappresenta una lacuna significativa. Sebbene l'orientamento sia menzionato in diverse parti del documento, la mancanza di una visione d'insieme e di obiettivi specifici limita l'efficacia delle azioni e rende difficile monitorarne l'impatto.

#### 2.2 Partnership e Reti
The school boasts a number of partnerships with local entities and institutions, including Unicredit, OCSE, ITS MAME, GEA - ETS, CONI, Università Federico II, Rete campana di biblioteche, and Dedalus. While these collaborations offer opportunities for internships, company visits, and training projects, the PTOF lacks detail on how these partnerships are strategically integrated into the guidance plan and contribute to specific learning outcomes. The partnership score reflects this limited integration.

#### 2.3 Finalità e Obiettivi
The aims of the guidance are oriented towards the development of students' aptitudes, interests, and preparation for life planning. However, the formulation of these objectives is often generic and lacks specificity. Objectives to reduce school dropout and promote lifelong learning are present, but are not supported by concrete actions or measurable indicators. This lack of operationalization hinders effective evaluation.

#### 2.4 Governance e Azioni di Sistema
Coordination of guidance services is entrusted to several designated individuals, but lacks an integrated system involving all stakeholders. Dialogue between teachers and students and the relationship with families are considered important, but specific actions to strengthen these connections are not described.

#### 2.5 Didattica Orientativa
The guidance teaching is mainly based on laboratory activities and students' direct experience. However, there is a lack of greater attention to the flexibility of spaces and times and to the interdisciplinary integration of activities. The score reflects the need for a more holistic and adaptable approach.

#### 2.6 Opportunità Formative
The offer of optional activities is diversified and includes cultural, laboratory, and sports courses. These activities offer students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop their passions.

#### 2.7 Registro Dettagliato delle Attività

#### 2.7.1 Stage/Tirocini
Internships represent a fundamental activity for the guidance of students at ITG-POLITECNICO-FERMI-GADDA. These courses, open to all students, offer the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired in class in a real work context, developing professional skills and guiding their future choices. The internships take place at companies in the area during the school year and are designed to provide students with a practical and concrete experience of the world of work.

#### 2.7.2 Visite guidate
Guided tours of middle schools are an important initiative to promote the institute and present the educational offer to potential students. These visits, which take place during the school year, offer middle school students the opportunity to get to know the school environment, laboratories, and activities proposed by ITG-POLITECNICO-FERMI-GADDA.

### 3. Punti di Forza
The main strengths of the PTOF are the presence of numerous partnerships with local entities and institutions, the offer of laboratory activities, and the diversification of optional activities. However, the long-term sustainability of these initiatives and their alignment with national standards require further consideration.

### 4. Aree di Debolezza
The main areas of weakness are the absence of a dedicated guidance section, the lack of specific and measurable objectives, and the poor integration of guidance actions into the school system.

### 5. Gap Analysis
The main gap is the lack of a strategic vision of guidance, which integrates the different actions and directs them towards the achievement of common goals. It is necessary to define a guidance plan that provides specific activities for each stage of the school career, involving all stakeholders.

### 6. Conclusioni
Guidance at ITG-POLITECNICO-FERMI-GADDA is an area in development, with significant room for improvement. Integrating guidance into the school system, defining specific and measurable objectives, and involving all stakeholders are key elements to ensure an effective and quality guidance offer. Furthermore, the PTOF should explicitly address how guidance activities are tailored to meet the needs of students with special educational needs (BES/DSA), leveraging existing PEI/PDP frameworks. The integration of the Digital Didactic Plan (DDI) into the guidance strategy also requires further development, outlining how digital tools and resources support remote guidance and career exploration.
